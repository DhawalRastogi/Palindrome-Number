# Palindrome-Number
I created a code which can check whether the given integer is a palindrome. There might be a simpler way to perform this task by using strings or arrays, but I wanted to challenge myself a bit by putting a restriction of not converting the integer into any other form of data type (expect float because it is created when we divide stuff).
