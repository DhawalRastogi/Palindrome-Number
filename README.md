# Palindrome-Number
A palindrome is a phrase, a word or a number which reads the same from backwards as from forwards.

I created a code which can check whether an integer is a palindrome. There might be a simpler way to perform this task by using strings or arrays, but I wanted to challenge myself a bit by putting a restriction of not converting the integer into any other form of data type (expect float because it is created when we divide stuff).

I've also attached a png image of the reasoning behind the crucial pattern recognition used in the code (thanks to my 12th grade maths teacher from whom I learned this skill).

Thank you
